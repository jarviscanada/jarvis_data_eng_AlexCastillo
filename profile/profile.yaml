From a young age, i was always draw to everything computer tech based and loved to mess with it.

    description: "For my Final Project, during my studies at ISI, I had to make a video game supervised by teachers with various planning software such as JIRA and GITHUB. In 2 and a half month, I was able to implement a lot of mechanics such as 2 player mode, combo system, an AI, an Online Mode with room making, Ranked Matchmaking, a training mode and various other features. I also hired people to help me as a team for features that were out of my programming expertise such as 2D artwork, 3D models and animations. We used TRELO to plan and manage the task of each member. I planned all my MILESTONES ahead with a SPRINT methodology. The project was made using Unity/C# and the animation were made with MAYA."
